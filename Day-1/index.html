            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Venkatesh, a passionate and self-motivated Java Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I hold a BBA in Computer Applications from SavitriBai Phule University, Pune with an 8.1 CGPA.

                I’ve built several frontend projects using JavaScript like a weather app, e-commerce site, temperature converter, and more. I’ve also gained hands-on experience through an internship as a Front-End Developer at Unique System Skills.
                
                Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in React.js and Java backend technologies like Servlets, JDBC, and Spring, and actively working on mini-projects to improve my DOM and JavaScript skills. My goal is to secure a frontend or full-stack development role where I can grow and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.</p>
